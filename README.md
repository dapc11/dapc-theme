# Dapc VSCode Theme

This is a custom dark theme I put together for VSCode to help reduce eye strain and keep things easy on the eyes. Inspired by Github Dark.

## What’s inside?

- Dark background with subtle contrasts
- Easy-to-read text colors
- Highlighted syntax that doesn’t hurt your eyes
- Custom colors for comments, keywords, strings, and more

## Why this theme?

I couldn’t find a dark theme that felt just right, so I made one tailored to my own preferences. Feel free to tweak it or use it as is.

## How to install

1. Download the theme folder
2. Run `vsce package` to create the `.vsix` file (make sure you have `vsce` installed)
3. In VSCode, go to Extensions > Install from VSIX and select the `.vsix` file
4. Activate the theme by going to Preferences > Color Theme and picking “Custom Dark Theme”
